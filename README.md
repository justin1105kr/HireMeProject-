# Setting up TODO list for my coding interview 
___

> I have not narrowed down the TODO lists for my specific purpose yet but I am willing to recall what I learnt in my bachelor's.  
> My project will be based on the git-hub called Coding Interview University, which is on top popular github list  

> [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md)  

> He says he studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. I bet that will also do for me
