### Setting up TODO list for my coding interview 
___   
> I have not narrowed down the TODO lists for my specific purpose yet but I am willing to recall what I learnt in my bachelor's.  
> My project will be based on the git-hub called Coding Interview University, which is on top popular github list  
> [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md)  
> He says he studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. I bet that will also do for me  
> I still need some research to find what I actually need besides computer science knowlege for __data science__          
> I also think that priorities on which subject are also important

___
### How to study and retain knowledge  
- Basic Rule : At Least One Chapter A Day    
- There may be some tasks that will take some days or some tasks will take only a couple of hours. I will try to balance it and document them on here.
1. Read a chapter of [meterials](#Meterials-I-am-going-to-use)
2. Put it into an actual code  
3. .... Updating ....
