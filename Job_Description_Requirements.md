#### __What is data science?__ 
  - Almost everything that has something to do with data:Collecting, Analyzing, Modeling... yet the most important part is ___its applications__
#### __Data Analyst__/__Data Engineer__/__ML Engineer__/__Data Scientist__  
+ __Data Analyst__ : __Data Analyst__ processes data provided by __Data Engineers(Backend Developer)__. They manage and maintain data or data dash board. They also set and analyze KPI(핵심성과지표) to find out reasons of changes of it. If new function is added or there is a need to see a specific log, they design data logs. 
+ __Data Engineer__ : Collect and refine data from applications or web so __data analyst__ can make use of it easily. They also manage the flow of data and develope dashboard for __data analyst__ to use.  
Trend these days is  
> 1) Data Engineers with capacity of developing back-end  
> 2) Data Engineers with knowledge of ML/DL  
> 3) Data Engineers who maily work with data engineering   
+ __ML Engineer__ : They work with models in specific domains(Computer Vision, Natural Language Process) and _apply these models to products. 
+ __Data Scientist__ : Mainly focus on theretical study in R&D department. Deep and profound knowledge of stastics is needed. They also do the works that __ML engineers__(Design, Modify models, develope additional models) do 
+ There are also other careers that I can follow such as Gross Hacker(Focusing on self-development more than on product using queries), Data Visualizers(Not many positions open in the market)
